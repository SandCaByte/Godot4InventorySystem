# Godot 4 Inventory System

\ This is a Godot 4 project was a learning project with the goal of creating an inventory system. I used a [MrAlphredo's tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN40PrPRDXs) to help get a basic understanding of how to accomplish something like this in GDScript. The changes I made to MrAlphredo's system are as follows:

- Made the code easier to read by adding comments and changing some confusing variable names
- Fixed a bug where spamming the "Create Item" button would crash the application
- Items can be used across multiple inventories
- Items are now stackable (two items can take up the same spot)
- The user can adject the color theme of the inventory
